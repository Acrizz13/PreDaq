    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

    <p>At our non-alcoholic beverage e-commerce store, we want you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. If for any reason you are not satisfied, we offer a refund policy to ensure your peace of mind.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Refunds are available for unopened and unused products returned within 30 days of delivery.</li>
        <li>Refund requests for products that are opened, used, or damaged may be subject to review and approval by our customer service team.</li>
        <li>Sale items and promotional products may have different refund policies, which will be clearly stated during the purchase process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Refund Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Contact our customer service team at <a href="mailto:support@example.com">support@example.com</a> to initiate a refund request.</li>
        <li>Provide your order number, product details, and reason for the refund request.</li>
        <li>Our customer service team will review your request and provide instructions for returning the product, if applicable.</li>

    <h2>Shipping Costs</h2>
    <p>In most cases, customers are responsible for the shipping costs associated with returning a product for a refund. However, if the refund request is due to an error on our part (e.g., incorrect or damaged product), we will cover the return shipping costs.</p>

    <h2>Exceptions</h2>
    <p>Please note that certain products may be non-refundable due to their nature, such as perishable goods or personalized items. Any exceptions to our refund policy will be clearly stated on the product page or during the purchase process.</p>
